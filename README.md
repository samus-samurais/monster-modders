# Monster Modders

## Introduction
Welcome to **_Monster Modders_**! A free to play web-based player vs. player halloween themed racing game with a twist! In this real-time online game, up to <em>four</em> players can join a lobby and play against each other by first building their way to the finish and then racing thereafter. The game will go round by round awarding players with points depending on which position they finish the round in. The player to first reach the points goal is crowned the winner!
